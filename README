This project is a chance for me to learn node.js/express so be nice if things are dumb.

The idea here was to make something that my friends could use to keep me updated on all of the funny pictures on reddit's front page (since I'm a hipster and unsubscribed from those subreddits long ago).

Design:
- single page blog post style thumbnails
- upload form ajax drops down from top
- socket.io updates page when new image is uploaded
- jquery fade in to make the ladies swoon
